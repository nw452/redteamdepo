276 [2017-10-12 18:10:05] - I enjoy nachos. Something Chipotle doesn't offer. When I used to eat Chipotle it was all rice in their burritos. All cheep filler.
277 [2017-10-12 18:09:52] - Nothing worse than the person rolling your burrito at chipotle doing an atrocious job.

366 [2017-10-12 17:53:15] - @ChipotleTweets your queso is shallow and pedantic. It reminds me of my ex wife Ruth soulless and boring.
