186 [2017-09-13 18:48:53] - Maybe an unpopular opinion(?): Chipotle's queso is gross.
187 [2017-09-13 18:48:41] - When you can finally afford the guac at @ChipotleTweets after a rough few weeks... pic.twitter.com/aCSnaN3Fpn
188 [2017-09-13 18:48:36] - Chipotles new queso is gritty and gross. Keep working on that recipe tho! I'm gonna stick to my chips and guacamole @ChipotleTweets
189 [2017-09-13 18:48:33] - @ChipotleTweets your queso has no flavor
190 [2017-09-13 18:48:33] - Chipotle queso is better than Moes. All you h8rs have no excuse to go to moes over chipotle now

196 [2017-09-13 18:47:52] - Just tried the queso today. It's pretty good!
197 [2017-09-13 18:47:47] - i love watching chipotle workers struggle to roll my fat ass burritos
198 [2017-09-13 18:47:45] - I just spent $20 on Postmates just so I can try chipotle's queso
199 [2017-09-13 18:47:44] - I mean I just had to try cause my foodie instincts told me so. Buy yeah that confirmed for me Moes > Chipotle
200 [2017-09-13 18:47:35] - @ChipotleTweets when you get a burrito and your first two bites are chewy alien meat and the third has a hair. #foolmeonce
202 [2017-09-13 18:47:31] - chipotle should focus on handmade tortillas instead of canned cheese.
203 [2017-09-13 18:47:26] - @ChipotleTweets thank u for the complete wrong order 
205 [2017-09-13 18:47:19] - I gave chipotle so many chances so done with them !

208 [2017-09-13 18:47:12] - @ChipotleTweets I'd rather take a shit in your burritos than eat your queso
209 [2017-09-13 18:47:11] - Upon further review, Moes is still leading in queso department. Edge to Chipotle in all other areas with the exception of upcharge on chips
210 [2017-09-13 18:47:04] - Because Chipotle sucks... https://twitter.com/BKMeinke_/status/908096864322539521 …

Chipotle queso, subway coldcuts, lemon flavored Italian ice
545 [2017-09-13 18:20:47] - ain't qdoba and chipotle the same company?
546 [2017-09-13 18:20:44] - Can anybody else confirm the Chipotle queso is whack? https://twitter.com/mariawicka/status/908105259620421632 …
547 [2017-09-13 18:20:42] - @ChipotleTweets are we allowed to sample the queso before we buy. Been hearing mixed reviews so I'm hesitant
548 [2017-09-13 18:20:36] - So tell me how chipotle literally only had chicken, hot salsa, cheese, and brown rice  No tortillas, lettuce, sour cream or anything
549 [2017-09-13 18:20:35] - Adam’s sister text me saying “I hope you know we’re sneaking chipotle into the movie theaters”  no wonder why we get along!
550 [2017-09-13 18:20:34] - do i want chipotle or am i just bored :/
551 [2017-09-13 18:20:27] - Disappointed by @ChipotleTweets new queso. It has a chalky texture and strange flavor.  Back to the drawing board!!!

562 [2017-09-13 18:19:09] - Dear @ChipotleTweets, hard to believe a busy downtown location doesn't have room for queso *and* chorizo. Why can't we have both? No bueno.

727 [2017-09-13 18:07:30] - Heard you have to pay for the Queso at Chipotle 
728 [2017-09-13 18:07:30] - It doesn't. You can find the ingredients here: http://chipotle.com/queso  -Becky
729 [2017-09-13 18:07:12] - Alright need to know before I try it. Is the Queso at chipotle good?
730 [2017-09-13 18:07:01] - The queso you get out of those chili and cheese machines at the gas station tastes better than @ChipotleTweets new "queso"
731 [2017-09-13 18:07:00] - Thanks Becky! As a suggestion: it's super grainy, too liquidy, and unappetizing. Too much seasoning overpowers any cheese taste.
732 [2017-09-13 18:06:56] - Thanks for stopping by! -Becky
734 [2017-09-13 18:06:53] - Whoever told @ChipotleTweets the queso was good is the same friend that doesn't tell you you have something in your teeth.
735 [2017-09-13 18:06:51] - Noting like eating bland Mexican food in a cold, dark, dirty restaurant.  @ChipotleTweets still sucks ass...@Moes_HQ is so much better.
737 [2017-09-13 18:06:48] - Hate to say this, but @ChipotleTweets somehow managed to mess up queso. How do you mess up liquid cheese? I dunno, but they managed...

1059 [2017-09-13 17:44:02] - Dear @ChipotleTweets I am used to silly #queso yours is way too grainy for my taste.  You can make it with real cheese and still be smooth!
1060 [2017-09-13 17:43:57] - I was fully prepared to be disappointed by Chipotle's queso. However, it's a little on the small side, but definitely delicious.
1061 [2017-09-13 17:43:54] - @ChipotleTweets why is your queso so gross??? Is it cream based and not cheese based???? #yuck
1063 [2017-09-13 17:43:43] - You need to learn about Moes. Chipotle is dog food compared to Moes
1064 [2017-09-13 17:43:39] - @ChipotleTweets is Chipotle in Weston open after Irma?
1065 [2017-09-13 17:43:38] - So what's this I hear chipotle stepped up in the world

1153 [2017-09-13 17:37:27] - You know you found the one when you go to Chipotle and they say "go ahead, get the guac AND queso"

1157 [2017-09-13 17:37:14] - Queso @Chipotle is overrated and underwhelming. $2.05 for a tiny little cup that won't feed 2 people +1 for the spice level. @ChipotleTweets
1158 [2017-09-13 17:37:04] - As have had I, I'm concerned.

1162 [2017-09-13 17:36:33] - @ChipotleTweets honestly I doubt many people care about you using preservatives. Please make normal queso
1163 [2017-09-13 17:36:32] - @Moes_HQ has queso all the time so you could just go there and it wouldn't be a sacrifice. Plus Moe's > Chipotle anyways...
1164 [2017-09-13 17:36:29] - I'm so sorry we let you down, and we're still working on our recipe. Hopefully we'll get to see you back again soon. -Becky

1943 [2017-09-13 16:38:28] - Don't get me wrong chipotle still tastes amazing.  But no queso is better than what they got.
1944 [2017-09-13 16:38:28] - @ChipotleTweets hey love your chips and guac but I'm always getting stale chips at my store. Would it be rude to ask for non-stale chips?
