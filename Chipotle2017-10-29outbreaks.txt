BUT Moe's > chipotle > qdoba
206 [2017-10-29 18:18:06] - Chipotle doesn’t know what queso tastes like, or was raised in a closet and only told what queso was for 25 years.
207 [2017-10-29 18:18:05] - You know you been in the gym when you eat chipotle and get hungry again soon after. Something may be wrong

234 [2017-10-29 18:13:07] - Cmon now g, A monster burrito cost the same as a chipotle burrito but way bigger & they just got more stuff you could put in your burrito
235 [2017-10-29 18:12:53] - You don’t get things in life unless you ask for them— much like the missing jalapeño Tabasco bottle at your local Chipotle
236 [2017-10-29 18:11:57] - Chipotle played lowkey

324 [2017-10-29 17:51:28] - Had Chipotle for the first time today. It's basically a Subway for burritos.
325 [2017-10-29 17:51:25] - I want chipotle, but don't want to GO GET chipotle...you see my dilemma?

334 [2017-10-29 17:49:02] - @ChipotleTweets “queso” is possibly the worst I’ve ever seen. Y’all need to come down here to the south to learn real queso.
335 [2017-10-29 17:48:51] - A commercial advertising Chipotles queso as this is a good thing. Tried it. Worst queso ever made. Worse than Panchos. @ChipotleTweets
336 [2017-10-29 17:48:47] - Also. Chipotle showed up way late with the queso anyways. Give Qdoba the crown.  https://twitter.com/prime_bee/status/924769241601069056 …

342 [2017-10-29 17:48:18] - Chipotle with Aladdin’s hot sauce is a game changer. 
343 [2017-10-29 17:48:08] - Dear @ChipotleTweets,

Please stop advertising how good your queso is. It's trash.

Thanks

(PS you can replace it by bringing back chorizo)
