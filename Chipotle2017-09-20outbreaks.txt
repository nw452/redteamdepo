26 [2017-09-20 18:55:29] - did some research and it looks like Chipotle is struggling. I cannot find a reason why they would be.
27 [2017-09-20 18:55:24] - If chipotle had delivery it would be great
28 [2017-09-20 18:55:05] - All we have on campus is a bad pizza place, subway, Panda Express and a bootleg chipotle

45 [2017-09-20 18:53:37] - Anyone else physically not able to put the lid back on a chipotle bowl once you take it off ?
46 [2017-09-20 18:53:31] - Unlikely. A broken sauce is not caused by unprocessed ingredients. It's probably just a temp thing.
48 [2017-09-20 18:53:05] - Hot take: I've had Chipotle's #Queso for the first & last time. Thanks for listening.

122 [2017-09-20 18:42:39] - Certainly; I just think it tells the wrong story as a result. Having lived it, “College and Chipotle” has made the most sense to me.
123 [2017-09-20 18:42:34] - Chipotle queso: imagine the best melted cheese you've ever had. After you've gone to the bathroom. Then eating it again. #NotThatGood

555 [2017-09-20 17:51:29] - Chipotle  https://twitter.com/sadiesgee/status/910301185554313217 …
556 [2017-09-20 17:51:24] - My biggest pet peeve is that singular person who is ordering for 5 people at chipotle.
557 [2017-09-20 17:51:23] - I suppose I'm naturally biased. Hope you'll try it! -James
558 [2017-09-20 17:51:21] - I WANT SOME MUHFUKN CHIPOTLE, pls :)
560 [2017-09-20 17:50:55] - Im bout to hit the local chipotle
561 [2017-09-20 17:50:46] - Just learned that Chipotle is now selling large size bags of chips. This could be dangerous...
562 [2017-09-20 17:50:30] - I'm pretty sure that's the only way to eat a Chipotle burrito.
563 [2017-09-20 17:50:24] - It can be different because we use unprocessed ingredients. Sorry you didn't like it. We'll let the right people know. -James
564 [2017-09-20 17:50:24] - Sorry we let you down. What happened? -James

569 [2017-09-20 17:49:38] - Chipotle's line should never be this long 
570 [2017-09-20 17:49:35] - Picked up @qdoba queso on my way home from work because I needed to remind myself just how superior its queso is to Chipotle's.

572 [2017-09-20 17:49:28] - Chipotle is just not worth the time or money for my hunger
573 [2017-09-20 17:49:27] - Right on! I'll send them some kudos. Thanks! -James
574 [2017-09-20 17:49:25] - If I can't get chipotle then someone else needs to get it lol
575 [2017-09-20 17:49:25] - I have had a weak appetite lately but, let me tell you, I just annihilated a Chipotle burrito and bag of chips to the bottom w/o looking up.
576 [2017-09-20 17:49:16] - Unprocessed shouldn’t mean lacking flavor or poor texture. I’m a huge Queso fan and this just simply wasn’t Queso. You guys can do better.
577 [2017-09-20 17:49:00] - It can be different because we use unprocessed ingredients. Sorry you didn't like it. We'll let the right people know. -James
578 [2017-09-20 17:48:51] - As if putting a whole thing of guac in the fridge instead of eating it immediately is less masochistic?
579 [2017-09-20 17:48:36] - I'm a grown ass woman, but no matter how grown I am my dad still won't let me pay for anything. Can't even pay for his chipotle. 
580 [2017-09-20 17:48:35] - It probably won't be long. Qdoba was here for 7 or 8 years before the first Chipotle opened.
581 [2017-09-20 17:48:28] - A BIG thank you to everyone that went to Chipotle last night to support our students! #yoursupportmatters

598 [2017-09-20 17:46:38] - Just tried the Chipotle queso. It sucks kids. Honestly, one of my worst burrito experiences ever.
599 [2017-09-20 17:46:37] - That's kinda rude assuming I only eat processed cheese! But truthfully the prob was that it was cold and lumpy.
600 [2017-09-20 17:46:30] - @ChipotleTweets queso blows. Smh.
601 [2017-09-20 17:46:21] - All I wanted was chipotle bbq and they gave me something completely else in a chipotle bbq box

610 [2017-09-20 17:45:35] - It hurts me more than anything to admit that Chipotle's queso is gross .
611 [2017-09-20 17:45:34] - It can be different because we use unprocessed ingredients. Sorry you didn't like it. We'll let the right people know. -James
612 [2017-09-20 17:45:21] - Dear @ChipotleTweets , you and I have vastly different definitions of what a large queso is. Also, cooked too long at too high a temp.
613 [2017-09-20 17:45:00] - Sorry about that! We really like it. It is different from most quesos, but that's because it's made with unprocessed ingredients.
615 [2017-09-20 17:44:37] - Mom got me chipotle with no guac and no sour cream, I think it's time I put her in a home
616 [2017-09-20 17:44:31] - @Luhhrees It can be different because we use unprocessed ingredients. Sorry you didn't like it. We'll let the right people know. -James

621 [2017-09-20 17:43:33] - One of the most satisfying texts I can get from my mom is "do you want chipotle?"
622 [2017-09-20 17:43:21] - I LOVEEE @ChipotleTweets but their #chipotlequeso might be the worst queso I've ever had in my life 
623 [2017-09-20 17:43:08] - It's sad to say but the best papers I've ever written are to chipotle and Taco Bell trying to get free food

638 [2017-09-20 17:40:30] - The amount of cars in the parking lot is NOT a good indicator of how many people are in line at Chipotle
639 [2017-09-20 17:40:12] - @Moes_HQ don't worry. Chipotle's queso is 
640 [2017-09-20 17:39:58] - It is not. Chipotle is good but there's like no seasoning

677 [2017-09-20 17:35:27] - @ChipotleTweets your buying the wrong cheese to make queso for your customers
678 [2017-09-20 17:35:13] - I haven’t but I can say I am a bit scared to try now. 
679 [2017-09-20 17:35:07] - Really feel bad for these people in this chipotle line cause I just got out of the gym so you know your girl stinks. P.S. I'm still waiting.
