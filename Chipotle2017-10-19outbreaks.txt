832 [2017-10-19 16:39:08] - God, you are dense. Nobody is saying that Chipotle should pay less. Nowhere in the report or news article was that stated.

841 [2017-10-19 16:37:50] - They didn't tell them to cut wages! Chipotle could pay $40/hr if they had the sales to support it and have no change in their forecast!
842 [2017-10-19 16:37:45] - hahah....I'm Downgrading @bofa haven't banked there in 20 years. Recently eaten at Chipotle tho.

872 [2017-10-19 16:33:53] - KFC, Taco Bell and Wendys pay similarly. And Chipotle didn't raise wages, the money problem is from declining customers after the food issue

888 [2017-10-19 16:31:35] - If Chipotle could increase sales, the % of costs associated with labor would go down to a more reasonable #, and there'd be no downgrade.

939 [2017-10-19 16:24:51] - Shareholders read forecasts to get an idea of how a stock is likely to perform. BofA's forecast can't make Chipotle do anything.
940 [2017-10-19 16:24:36] - Plaudit Place location in Lexington, KY. They said they had a catering order that wiped them out. No biggie, just missed the chips.
