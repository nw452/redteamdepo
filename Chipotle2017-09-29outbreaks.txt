@ChipotleTweets. I love y'all - I truly do, but I'm not a big fan of the Queso. It's better at a hotter temp for sure.
74 [2017-09-29 18:51:00] - It can be different because we use unprocessed ingredients. Sorry you didn't like it. We'll let the right people know. -James

102 [2017-09-29 18:45:31] - Does anybody else not really care for the new @ChipotleTweets queso? It’s grainy and lacking flavor.
103 [2017-09-29 18:45:25] - That's because @ChipotleTweets rarely gives correct double servings. Learned that lesson 5 too many times lol
104 [2017-09-29 18:45:24] - People who vote “no” don’t do chipotle right...

120 [2017-09-29 18:42:58] - A lot. Papa and Chipotle are brothers. Collusion at its finest. It's early though, see if they are at the top later.
121 [2017-09-29 18:42:47] - It's 2017 and Chipotle's lines are still trash.
122 [2017-09-29 18:42:23] - Why are all chipotle workers the same 
124 [2017-09-29 18:41:49] - Chipotle burrito > guacamole and chips > nothing.  Thanks @CurleyAdmission #CurleyMixer

400 [2017-09-29 17:53:01] - Here to report the new queso phenomena at Chipotle is not worth the upsell charge they’re asking for it.
401 [2017-09-29 17:52:55] - Late lunch with tha love of my life. #lovingher (@ Chipotle Mexican Grill in Las Vegas, NV) https://www.swarmapp.com/c/7qXgyABVzxN

403 [2017-09-29 17:51:46] - They were running low on everything especially on the meat. I was given just a small portion and I was passed down like nothing happened
404 [2017-09-29 17:51:32] - Chipotle queso review: not terrible IN a burrito. terrible with just chips.

409 [2017-09-29 17:51:01] - I did. And had to keep asking because they continued to do it with the adjusted portions! Horrible customer service.
410 [2017-09-29 17:49:55] - Idk what @ChipotleTweets put in their mild sauce today, but i cant feel my mouth rn. 
411 [2017-09-29 17:49:39] - I've never had moes. I'm gonna try it next week. Id say jar Tostitos queso is better than Chipotle. Taco bell nacho cheese 100x better.
412 [2017-09-29 17:49:14] - Not with chipotle. Maybe with pizza. No veggies. Just pepperoni or cheese. 

Have you been watching videos on #thekatsfamilycargiveaway ?

417 [2017-09-29 17:48:30] - I don't think chipotle would exist if green Tabasco didn't as well. They should consider having small to go packets of it.
418 [2017-09-29 17:48:29] - I'll share this with their management. You should get eight ounces of meat with double steak. -James
420 [2017-09-29 17:48:26] - The manager of the @ChipotleTweets apologized for the wait. They’ve had 3 call off this shift. That sucks

1383 [2017-09-29 14:54:54] - Hass is better than chipotle. Hass is better than Moes. Hass is better than Qdoba. Hass is better.

1391 [2017-09-29 14:53:02] - That shouldn't be the case except for our meats, Sofritas, and guac. Please chat with a manager if it happens again. -Gabe

1484 [2017-09-29 14:41:23] - I see now. 
No ice for sodas and was told they would be cold anyway, they weren't.  Stale chips. Mediocre service.
