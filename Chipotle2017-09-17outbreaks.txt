1610 [2017-09-17 14:42:33] - They said the look may not be super consistent cuz of the fresh ingredients and lack of preservatives but i keep hearing mixed reviews :/
1611 [2017-09-17 14:42:11] - Need some chipotle in my life
1612 [2017-09-17 14:42:00] - We're keeping those an in-store thing for the time being. Sorry for the inconvenience. -James

1616 [2017-09-17 14:41:23] - Right? I can make queso with real ingredients that's better.  granted it's not for the masses but it reheats well. It's not alright.
1617 [2017-09-17 14:41:12] - I'm like 2 years late on the chipotle hype but it's coo it's coo
1618 [2017-09-17 14:41:09] - Chipotle can give up on queso. It's a no for me dawg.
1619 [2017-09-17 14:41:07] - This sort of marketing is just tiring. Doesn’t give good feelings when I just want a burrito. #keeppoliticsoutofburritos @ChipotleTweets pic.twitter.com/BmusDsxFip

1626 [2017-09-17 14:39:30] - Yeah I mean I melt a lot of cheese but this is clearly a consistency issue. The cheese chemistry is not right.

1671 [2017-09-17 14:32:39] - So chipotle seeds are resilient vs roasting. Not that you can't roast them. But they'll destroy your sensory organs if you try.
1672 [2017-09-17 14:32:28] - @ChipotleTweets wtf is that thing you call "queso" it taste like ass!! #wasteofmoney !!

1676 [2017-09-17 14:31:53] - Nap... then go get some Panera or Olive Garden or chipotle then watch the boys play.
1677 [2017-09-17 14:31:51] - just made homemade chipotle, GOD DAMN IS IT FUCKIN SCRUMPTIOUS
1678 [2017-09-17 14:31:36] - After much deliberation, I have come to the conclusion that Chipotle Queso is aggressively below average, a strong 3/10. Also, go Browns
1679 [2017-09-17 14:31:30] - A guy at chipotle got lettuce on his burrito bowl bc he "needed something healthy"
1680 [2017-09-17 14:31:18] - Today I ate chipotle for the first time since 2014 and the guac WASN'T extra #livingmybestlife
1682 [2017-09-17 14:30:42] - Conspiracy theory: Chipotle has been subtly reducing the size of their serving spoon thingys
1683 [2017-09-17 14:30:37] - I've heard nothing but mediocre/awful reviews about the queso which is the biggest disappointment.
1684 [2017-09-17 14:30:24] - It's pretty good and I winged it with chipotle chilli flakes instead of whole ones.
1685 [2017-09-17 14:29:58] - Dangerous place that Chipotle.

1688 [2017-09-17 14:29:04] - @ChipotleTweets why wouldn't y'all pick a white queso? Did your team do any research? Reviews are horrible.
1689 [2017-09-17 14:29:03] - Disappointed in @ChipotleTweets queso. Grainy and not much flavor. Cheese with @tacojohns nachos is so much better. #fb

1790 [2017-09-17 14:12:56] - I tried the queso from @ChipotleTweets and it was a greasy, chunky mess. Not sure if it was just my location or that's normal, but pass.
1791 [2017-09-17 14:12:25] - Didn’t have a chance, we took the food home to eat
1792 [2017-09-17 14:12:06] - After today @ChipotleTweets is about to be a dub...because there is no reason for my food to be leaking

1826 [2017-09-17 14:07:53] - Same. I didn't think it was 'gross' per se, but it's definitely aggressively underwhelming and kind of weirdly watery.
1827 [2017-09-17 14:07:31] - Trying to find someone who likes chipotle & watching soccer/football as much as me
1828 [2017-09-17 14:07:29] - Sorry it let you down! We have high hopes for it and will work to make it the best it can be. -James

1851 [2017-09-17 14:03:57] - It was like finding out Santa wasn't real. I didn't want to believe the initial reviews.
1852 [2017-09-17 14:03:49] - If you don't love chipotle and sushi what's wrong with ya?
1853 [2017-09-17 14:03:43] - a straight pride parade would just be a bunch of guys driving their bitchy girlfriends to chipotle and then filming their happy dance
