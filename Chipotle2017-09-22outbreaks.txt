1901 [2017-09-22 14:36:16] - What's worse than getting a chipotle bowl with uncooked rice? Nothing
1902 [2017-09-22 14:36:11] - When you closed down again for salmonella. And @Moes_HQ is still better
1903 [2017-09-22 14:36:11] - Feels like just yesterday I saw you guys at the chipotle festival here a few years ago! So hyped to see you again tonight. See ya soon

1910 [2017-09-22 14:35:47] - Always have to respect the 'multiple-order-at-chipotle' guy. You know that he's heavily relied on and clutch during pressured situations.
1911 [2017-09-22 14:35:39] - Chipotle's queso is in no way a gamechanger. I'll go back to Qdoba where there are more choices and they don't charge extra for it.
1912 [2017-09-22 14:35:36] - I see where people are coming from on @ChipotleTweets queso, but I like it so much more because it actually tastes like real cheese.
1913 [2017-09-22 14:35:32] - Life is good. Let a manager know next though so we can get you the perfect meal. _tay
