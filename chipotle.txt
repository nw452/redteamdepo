10 [2017-06-03 23:40:05] - Legit it's no joke I got E. coli from chipotle during the outbreak and I haven't eaten it since aka over a yr ago
11 [2017-06-03 22:44:58] - Or go to Moes and don't pay extra? Oh and also not get E. Coli. Fuck you, Chipotle. You're a hot plate of garbage. https://twitter.com/chipotletweets/status/866352892738928641 …

32 [2017-06-09 20:22:38] - Is Chipotle trying to take the nurses out first with their e.coli laced fare?
34 [2017-06-09 20:15:50] - Good. The e coli from Chipotle cost too much. https://twitter.com/OnionSports/status/873344236867002368 …

29 [2017-06-05 17:40:25] - Apparently Chipotle was hacked & ppl's credit card info may be compromised. If the e coli didn't stop you then you deserve this pic.twitter.com/rJ3Pnjd1kf

41 [2017-06-07 13:36:58] - i think the fact that i still ate chipotle during the E. coli scare proves the fact that i would literally die chipotle

54 [2017-06-15 16:21:51] - @Moes_HQ: it's chipotle without the E. Coli
55 [2017-06-15 12:32:24] - There was already a Chipotle rehab, it was called E. Coli. Day late and a dollar short Pat.
56 [2017-06-15 00:05:20] - also, it's weird how TJs recalls products on the reg yet never really seems to be impacted by it a la Chipotle's e. coli downfall.
57 [2017-06-14 21:54:17] - Man chipotle tastes like dirt ever since the E.coli outbreak. Used to be so good, now it's just bland and boring.

60 [2017-06-16 19:49:36] - Only thing Chipotle has to offer is e coli and salmonella. For that reason I am way out
61 [2017-06-14 15:52:45] - Well, @Time that's pretty smart move by Chipotle. If they experience another E. coli outbreak the RNs will recognize it right away. https://twitter.com/TIME/status/875092995934179333 …
62 [2017-06-14 13:50:26] - I'll never eat at chipotle again after that whole E. coli incident
63 [2017-06-14 08:55:43] - It's a shame, but I'd actually be afraid of it now.  I can't eat something I'm afraid of, like Chipotle...loved it until the E. coli problem
64 [2017-06-14 05:12:34] - I love qdoba... it's similar to chipotle but when I order a burrito I don't have to ask them to hold the E. coli
65 [2017-06-13 22:25:46] - Chipotle is giving nurses free burritos.

I assume that's because nurses have the most experience treating E. Coli?
66 [2017-06-18 18:32:50] - I had Chipotle on Friday & shit got me fucked up for 2 days. E. coli seems right, but still not sure yet. 
67 [2017-06-18 18:00:33] - For a place that was recently responsible for an E. Coli outbreak, you'd think Chipotle would have more than one toilet in their bathroom
68 [2017-06-18 16:13:00] - Chipotle Pro: good food
Chipotle Con: occasional e coli 

BB Pro: cheap guac

80 [2017-06-16 13:57:00] - Considering what Chipotle does to my stomach, I'm surprised people knew there was an E. coli outbreak.

83 [2017-06-16 12:31:07] - This chipotle has hand sanitizer in the restroom which could easily be mixed up w soap. This is why you have an E. coli issue!!!!

85 [2017-06-16 10:24:57] - There was never a case of e coli at Chipotle in New Jersey and that was over 2 years ago in the other stores
86 [2017-06-16 09:40:07] - Well I think it was last year. A bunch of Chipotle stores closed because of E. Coli. Didn't stop my love for it though
87 [2017-06-15 20:41:52] - Enjoy your E. coli from Chipotle
