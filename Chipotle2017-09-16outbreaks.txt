922 [2017-09-16 16:44:42] - Verdict on Chipotle queso: not bad. Doesn't add much flavor though (but good spice), def not worth $1.30. Qdoba blows it out of the water.
923 [2017-09-16 16:44:40] - I checked in at Chipotle Mexican Grill on #Yelphttps://www.yelp.com/biz/chipotle-mexican-grill-mclean-3?pt=check_in&ref=twitter&utm_campaign=CheckIn&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=ishare&v=4b …

949 [2017-09-16 16:41:15] - Chipotle's queso: pretty bland and oddly grainy. I'd eat it again if it was free... But that's about it.
