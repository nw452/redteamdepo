97 [2017-10-08 18:42:31] - Yes, weak. There was not even a full scoop of rice or meat in either one. Then they decide to load up on condiments. Very light overall.

115 [2017-10-08 18:39:51] - chipotle literally looses all of its flavor when it is eaten on a metal fork at home #ugh #

890 [2017-10-08 16:07:29] - I wouldn't eat at Chipotle anyway, but that queso looks gross. I read it has a weird tang to it. Possibly listeria.
891 [2017-10-08 16:07:29] - It took chipotle 24 years to finally give us queso and all they could deliver is this shit that taste like plastic?
892 [2017-10-08 16:07:25] - Just saw a great @chipotle commercial. So fresh and awesome. Maybe the south MYrtle Beach store should watch? There yesterday. Sucktastick.

902 [2017-10-08 16:07:09] - Chipotle has the worst commercial about getting Queso. "Did we see it coming?" Uh, yes...because you should have had it since you opened.

952 [2017-10-08 16:05:11] - I wanted to go to Chipotle but dylan didn’t. Dylan wanted to go to panera but I didn’t, so we compromised by going to panera
