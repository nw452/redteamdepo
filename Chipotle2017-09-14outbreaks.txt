634 [2017-09-14 17:59:34] - And the verdict on @ChipotleTweets new queso is...underwhelming. I'm wondering if they used Texas as a test market. It's watery, not creamy. https://twitter.com/georgedeines/status/908103491830284289 …
635 [2017-09-14 17:59:29] - @ChipotleTweets your new queso taste like butt cheese, please fix it.

712 [2017-09-14 17:51:25] - @ChipotleTweets the queso blows
713 [2017-09-14 17:50:54] - If you don't got chipotle napkins in ya glove compartment we prolly not gonna workout
714 [2017-09-14 17:50:54] - No plans as of now, but I highly recommend a bag of chips with your bowl. -Gabe
715 [2017-09-14 17:50:37] - I can't even wait in a chipotle line that long https://twitter.com/trevdon/status/907675202481295360 …
716 [2017-09-14 17:50:34] - Chipotle has queso now... that's a game changer
717 [2017-09-14 17:50:30] - Gabe, I have to agree. The queso at my location was thicc, but it tasted more like flour than cheese or spices.
718 [2017-09-14 17:50:28] - Getting chipotle will make me feel better about how much I hate school :-)
719 [2017-09-14 17:50:27] - When I get my order filled I'm left with very light scoops of what's scraped off the bottom of a tin of rice & chicken. 45 min for that!
720 [2017-09-14 17:50:27] - Not even queso will make chipotle better than qdoba
721 [2017-09-14 17:50:11] - When you come home drunk at 2AM and want queso, but don't have the right kind of cheese...That's what the Chipotle queso tastes like

726 [2017-09-14 17:49:12] - Is chipotle queso worth it?
727 [2017-09-14 17:49:08] - Chipotle needs to redo their queso...No match for Qdoba
728 [2017-09-14 17:49:08] - Please recognize 394 Myrtle Ave location in Brooklyn. The team is amazing. . They really made my experience worth while. 
729 [2017-09-14 17:49:01] - Why did no one tell me Chipotle has queso now??? #blessed 
730 [2017-09-14 17:48:52] - Chipotle Queso. 4/10. Will try again.
731 [2017-09-14 17:48:49] - I was very hopeful @ChipotleTweets however I'm very disappointed in the new #queso 
732 [2017-09-14 17:48:40] - I love you @ChipotleTweets but your queso not so much definetly needs some revisions
733 [2017-09-14 17:48:34] - @animasolaarts That would be amazing! What are they key components to a perfect breakfast taco?
734 [2017-09-14 17:48:33] - Guys, our chipotle location finally got queso!
735 [2017-09-14 17:48:24] - This line at @ChipotleTweets is outrageous.
736 [2017-09-14 17:48:17] - i wanna get to the point in my life where i have a free chipotle for life card
738 [2017-09-14 17:48:13] - SHANE HAS HIS OWN CHIPOTLE CARD AHAHAH MY GOALS

745 [2017-09-14 17:47:39] - Finally get to front of the line and I have to wait for staff to fill 4 to go orders in front of me.

749 [2017-09-14 17:47:23] - Queso from chipotle good??
750 [2017-09-14 17:47:22] - I'm here to say the new queso dip at Chipotle is absolute garbage.
751 [2017-09-14 17:47:08] - @ChipotleTweets I would love to get @GordonRamsay thoughts on what you are trying to pass as "queso"
752 [2017-09-14 17:47:07] - Chipotle is so needed rn.
753 [2017-09-14 17:47:02] - I'm in class n some kid just pulled chipotle out of his backpack  the professor gives no fucks. College is not like high school lol

756 [2017-09-14 17:46:39] - I kinda like the new Chipotle queso #AMA
757 [2017-09-14 17:46:33] - Amateur hour at Chipotle with the queso launch. Feel for the staff when people don't know how to order from a menu with 6 things on it.
758 [2017-09-14 17:46:31] - We appreciate that. -Gabe
759 [2017-09-14 17:46:31] - I'm sorry it wasn't right on point. We'll keep working to improve the recipe. -Gabe

769 [2017-09-14 17:45:31] - @ChipotleTweets Queso rating: 6/10. Definitely not worth $3.35 for chips and queso.
770 [2017-09-14 17:45:22] - I wish i could find the satisfaction in another human that i find in a chipotle burrito
771 [2017-09-14 17:45:13] - God damn I didn't think it could even be possible to make @ChipotleTweets better but wow does Queso take it to another level

773 [2017-09-14 17:45:04] - @Jennifreshhhh ditched me and Lorenzo at chipotle
774 [2017-09-14 17:45:04] - From what I've had so far, chipotle's queso is trash.
775 [2017-09-14 17:44:59] - No bc Qdoba is the best thing to happen in life, Chipotle is lame!!!
776 [2017-09-14 17:44:59] - My supervisor canceled my meeting so she can go to chipotle 
777 [2017-09-14 17:44:59] - I don't actually think I've had Chipotle. I will seek one out eventually. Also, sorry for @'ing you. I broke the first rule of your tweet.
778 [2017-09-14 17:44:54] - Y'all don't get @ChipotleTweets queso....it's disgusting.

784 [2017-09-14 17:44:37] - Qdoba nachos are legit. I bet a chicken finger from raisin canes would go with either places queso
785 [2017-09-14 17:44:35] - I had a clever tweet ready about how all queso is good. Was going to use it after eating the Chipotle queso but honestly, the queso was wack
786 [2017-09-14 17:44:33] - I feel so sick  I can't even keep my food down and I really wanted that chipotle 
787 [2017-09-14 17:44:31] - I'll share them here Gabe. Even the Tabasco sauce that saves 2 week old rice couldn't help. I didn't know you could take flavor out of queso
788 [2017-09-14 17:44:28] - Chipotle queso is the real deal 
789 [2017-09-14 17:44:27] - chipotle queso is trash

796 [2017-09-14 17:43:49] - The chipotle queso is not cheesy at all. Like how are you supposed to be queso but not be cheesy? 
797 [2017-09-14 17:43:48] - I need to try Chipotle's queso, gorge myself on Thai Thai, and also eat Chick-fil-A for all three meals of my last 6 days in US
798 [2017-09-14 17:43:44] - Smoked paprika, Chipotle paste, regular paprika, scotch bonnet sauce (lazy as no actual bonnets), coriander, cumin, lil bit of 'cajun'
799 [2017-09-14 17:43:40] - Chipotle's queso is so disappointing

810 [2017-09-14 17:42:57] - Chipotle you disappointed me today 
811 [2017-09-14 17:42:53] - chipotle is a burrito powerhouse of ineffable delight

But whichever chef created their queso

821 [2017-09-14 17:41:55] - Chipotle once gave everyone in my class indigestion, so....

842 [2017-09-14 17:40:03] - Chipotle > qdoba with or without the queso 
843 [2017-09-14 17:39:58] - Chipotle don't give a nigga a break. They got more fees and extras then a dam cellphone company

848 [2017-09-14 17:39:26] - But back to the queso. Chipotle's needs a little more spice or at least two/three options like the salsas
849 [2017-09-14 17:39:18] - Second person I know to say this. So sad.

853 [2017-09-14 17:39:00] - So TECHNICALLY @ChipotleTweets > @qdoba from a total value/consumer interaction perspective.
854 [2017-09-14 17:39:00] - I still love burrito bowls from Chipotle. Don't @ me.
855 [2017-09-14 17:38:57] - @ChipotleTweets I've been in line for 40 minutes watching the line fill orders from the app every few minutes. Need a separate station
856 [2017-09-14 17:38:54] - 2/2 @ChipotleTweets ...bring in the breakfast tacos that everyone's been asking for since the dawn of time or at least since you went public

866 [2017-09-14 17:38:17] - Should've just listened to everyone else but I had to try it for myself. The chipotle queso is disgusting 
867 [2017-09-14 17:38:05] - I had 4 cups of coffee yesterday and one meal, and that meal was chipotle. College.
868 [2017-09-14 17:37:56] - @ChipotleTweets Why is your queso grainy? Also it's too bitter and the spices are wrong. Huge disappointment.
869 [2017-09-14 17:37:50] - When the chipotle girl forgets to charge you for extra steak >>>>
870 [2017-09-14 17:37:47] - So technically, @qdoba wins because it just doesn't cost more.

872 [2017-09-14 17:37:32] - So the verdict on @ChipotleTweets  queso:

Decent. It IS a bummer that it's extra
874 [2017-09-14 17:37:29] - @ChipotleTweets y'all better start adding guac in for free to make up for this abomination you call "queso"
875 [2017-09-14 17:37:27] - Man, you had a rough lunch break.
877 [2017-09-14 17:37:22] - Could seriously go for some Chipotle/Qdoba
878 [2017-09-14 17:37:15] - Chipotle's queso is repulsive
879 [2017-09-14 17:37:09] - I can't believe they'd even try
880 [2017-09-14 17:37:08] - some chipotle would really shmack rn
882 [2017-09-14 17:37:03] - @ChipotleTweets queso tastes like mashed potatoes
883 [2017-09-14 17:37:01] - @ChipotleTweets a long time waiting and very disappointed by the queso

1381 [2017-09-14 16:41:04] - Chipotle's main thing is that they use real ingredients. I hate to break it to y'all, cheese isn't liquid at room temperature naturally
1382 [2017-09-14 16:40:56] - I honestly feel like it was unnecessary for the girl at Chipotle to keep calling me "ma'am"
1383 [2017-09-14 16:40:53] - Chipotle had queso now?! YESSSSSSSSS
1384 [2017-09-14 16:40:52] - Lmao remember when the hwhites were hmad because chipotle used Bay leaf as seasoning and they didn't recognize it

1417 [2017-09-14 16:37:33] - Chipotle's new queso needs a little more spice to it. But it's serviceable. The "game manager" of quesos.
