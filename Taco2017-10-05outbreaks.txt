1949 [2017-10-05 12:47:27] - Eating a lot of Taco Bell has really turned me off of other fast foods. For almost the price of McDonald's chicken strips, I get a box.
1950 [2017-10-05 12:47:26] - Monstrously excited to see @Kathbum in Woking tomorrow. Combined with the fact there is a Taco Bell there, it's basically a dream eve

1973 [2017-10-05 12:42:37] - I pay Taco Bell to eat Taco Bell.
1974 [2017-10-05 12:42:30] - (I still think this only solidified my position on #noice). The only time ice should be used is to cool a drink that is not already cool.

1981 [2017-10-05 12:41:02] - Is it wrong to eat Taco Bell before the gym, cause if so then I’m wrong and I’m okay with that.
1982 [2017-10-05 12:40:56] - This could well explain a whooollleee lot.
1983 [2017-10-05 12:40:40] - this is you walking into taco bell
1984 [2017-10-05 12:40:39] - My sacrifices will never be repaid.
1985 [2017-10-05 12:40:35] - No, but the gas stations that sell 32oz highlife cans is right across the street from the taco bell.
