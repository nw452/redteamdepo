1994 [2015-09-06 12:01:30] - @chandler_ace i still haven't tried taco bell breakfast though
1995 [2015-09-06 12:01:13] - Been making room all day. @tacobell we're coming for you and our nacho cheese void is quivering.
1996 [2015-09-06 12:01:06] - I'm in need of some Taco Bell.
1997 [2015-09-06 12:01:03] - Me going to Taco Bell: Kelly calls me ma'am and I sing David Crowder to her
1998 [2015-09-06 12:00:59] - All I wanted was @tacobell today. Instead, after waiting 10 mins to order they tell me food will be another 20 mins. @kfc it is
1999 [2015-09-06 12:00:32] - So John Wall turned 25 today. I'm almost 27 and I just woke up, trying to figure out if I want Taco Bell for lunch or not.
