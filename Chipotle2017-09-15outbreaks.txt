450 [2017-09-15 18:06:14] - Now @chipotle y'all have sent one too many people to the hospital for food poisoning/ecoli to be charging extra for queso
451 [2017-09-15 18:06:13] - Really?? Or they could be consistent on how they make their food. Person sitting next to me has a bowl that can't contain all the food.

564 [2017-09-15 17:53:10] - The best way to enjoy Chipotle's new queso is to dump it all in the garbage and go to Taco Bell and eat their queso instead
565 [2017-09-15 17:52:55] - CHIPOTLE WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST TODAY!
